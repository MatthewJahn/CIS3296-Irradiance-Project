# CIS3296-Irradiance-Project

## For the Fall 2019 CIS3296 Group Project 
## by Matthew Jahn, Claire Tranh Tran, Shakeel Alibhai, Shane Zimmie, and Bassam Alkhdedy

This github is for documenting the progress of the Irradiance Project in a large, abstract way. 
Commits were not made to this repository for version control or sharing, rather that was done via mass email between group members. This was specifically due to the nature of the jupyter notebook files being particularly difficult to share via github for smaller updates.

The commits herein represent large version releases done by a single member or a small group of members that were subsequently emailed to everyone for the next stage of development whether in a single milestone or within multiple milestones. Smaller changes and additions of immature features were naturally a part of that development, but are not documented here.

The general breakdown of work was in two smaller teams. Matthew and Claire worked on developing the model and then new features into the model (e.g. Prediction, WeatherAPI). Shakeel, Shane and Bassam worked on tuning the model to get more accuracy out of the model and better end results.

## Running the Project

The .ipynb file should be run in Jupyter Notebook, which can be acquired by downloading the Anaconda suite of products. In order for the code to run Keras and Theano should be installed onto anaconda by typing the following commands into Anaconda Prompt

conda install jupyter
conda install pandas
pip install keras
pip install theano

Alternatively a .py file is located in the github, which can be run. However, this may cause unexpected behavior and exists as a last resort, running the notebook file is recommended instead.
